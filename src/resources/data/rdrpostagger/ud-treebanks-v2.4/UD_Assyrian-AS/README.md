# Summary

The Uppsala Assyrian Treebank is a small treebank for Modern Standard Assyrian. The corpus is collected and annotated manually. The data was randomly collected from different textbooks and a short translation of The Merchant of Venice.

# Introduction

The Uppsala Assyrian Treebank (UAT) is a small treebank which consists of 57 sentences and cirka 380 tokens. The data was randomly collected from different textbooks and a short translation of The Merchant of Venice. 
The treebank was manually built and annotated following the UD annotation guidlines.
This treebank is the very first attempt to building a treebank for the Modern Standard Assyrian language, and since it is a very small treebank, we kept the data in one file as test data. 

We look forward to increasing the size of the treebank and enriching its annotation in the future.

# Acknowledgments

Building the Uppsala Assyrian Treebank was a project conducted by Mary Yako at Uppsala University under the supervision of Joakim Nivre.
