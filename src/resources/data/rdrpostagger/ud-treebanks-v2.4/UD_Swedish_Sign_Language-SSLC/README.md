# Summary

The Universal Dependencies treebank for Swedish Sign Language (ISO 639-3: swl)
is derived from the Swedish Sign Language Corpus (SSLC) from the department of
linguistics, Stockholm University.

# Introduction

    http://www.ling.su.se/english/research/research-projects/sign-language

Selected portions of SSLC have been manually annotated according to our
adapted version of the Universal Dependencies guidelines.

# Acknowledgments

Syntactic annotation is mainly due to Moa Gärdenfors with assistance from Carl
Börstell and Mats Wiren. Carl Börstell, Robert Östling and Lars Wallin have
contributed to the part-of-speech annotations. Robert Östling has contributed
software for converting between the annotation format (ELAN) and CoNLL-U.
