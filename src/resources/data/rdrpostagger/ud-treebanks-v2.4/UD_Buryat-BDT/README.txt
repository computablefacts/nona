# Summary

The UD Buryat treebank was annotated manually natively in UD and contains grammar book sentences, along with
news and some fiction.

# Introduction

The treebank was annotated manually for part-of-speech, lemmas and dependency relations, and morphological
features were added automatically using a finite-state transducer based on these.
