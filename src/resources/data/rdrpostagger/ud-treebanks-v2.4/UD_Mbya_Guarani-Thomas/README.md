# Introduction

UD Mbya_Guarani-Thomas is a corpus of Mbyá Guaraní (Tupian) texts collected by Guillaume Thomas. The current version of the corpus consists of three speeches by Paulina Kerechu Núñez Romero, a Mbyá Guaraní speaker from Paraguay. These speeches were recorded in August 2017 in the Mbyá Guaraní community Ytu, Caazapá Department, Paraguay. They were transcribed by Ronaldi Recalde Centurion (Ytu community) and translated into Brazilian Portuguese by Alberto Álvares. The texts were interlinearized in SIL FieldWorks Language Explorer (Black and Simons 2006) and manually annotated in UD in Arborator (Gerdes 2013) by Guillaume Thomas. Features were converted automatically from the morphological glosses added in SIL FieldWorks Language Explorer.

Consider using the development version of the corpus, which contains the latest improvements, while the official release is updated every 6 months:

# Acknowledgments

The development of the corpus was supported by a Connaught New Researcher Award to Guillaume Thomas at the University of Toronto.

Special thanks are due to Paulina Kerechu Núñez Romero for allowing us to use these recordings, and to Ronaldi Recalde Centurion and Alberto Álvares for their essential role in transcribing and translating these recordings.
