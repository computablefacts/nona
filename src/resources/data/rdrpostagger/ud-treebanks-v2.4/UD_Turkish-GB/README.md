# Summary

This is a treebank annotating example sentences from a comprehensive grammar book of Turkish.

# Introduction

This treebank was originally annotated with the aim of setting guidelines for the Turkish UD.
All fields are annotated manually for UD v1.
The conversion to v2 was performed semi-automatically.
Further information on the treebank and the annotation process can be found
at the [the treebank web page](http://coltekin.github.io/gk-treebank/).
