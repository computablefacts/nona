# Summary

A small Sanskrit treebank of sentences from Pañcatantra, an ancient Indian
collection of interrelated fables by Vishnu Sharma.


# Introduction

Annotation of this treebank started as a student internship project at
ÚFAL, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Prague.

The Sanskrit text is also available from Wikisource and from the Sanskrit
Documents website; note however that the exact wording at these sources
sometimes differs.

We were only able to add syntactic annotation to a tiny
fraction of Pañcatantra, namely to the preface about
creation of Pañcatantra, and to the beginning of the
first section called Mitrabheda.


# Acknowledgments

The [Sanskrit Reader](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/) by Gérard Huet was of
immense help during the segmentation, lemmatization and morphological
analysis of the text.
