# Summary

This is a North Sámi treebank based on a manually disambiguated and function-labelled gold-standard
corpus of North Sámi produced by the Giellatekno team at UiT Norgga árktalaš universitehta.

# Introduction

The corpus was first analysed using a finite-state morphological analyser for North Sámi, and then
disambiguated using a constraint-grammar-based disambiguator. The constraint grammar disambiguator
also annotated syntactic function labels. The analyses and the function labels were manually
corrected to produce a gold standard, and then a rule-based dependency parser was run on top
of the gold data. On top of those parsers a series of tree-rewrite rules were used to convert
the corpus to Universal Dependencies. Please see the paper below for details.

# Acknowledgements

We are immensely grateful to the Giellatekno team, and especially to Trond Trosterud and Lene Antonsen
for annotating the original data and for producing the rule-based parser on which the treebank is
based. Their comments and help were invaluable.
